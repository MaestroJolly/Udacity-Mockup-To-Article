You've learned a lot about web development so far. I want you to take a moment to write down your thoughts about web development here. Answer the following questions:
  * What new skills have you learned?
  * What has been easy?
  * What has been difficult?
  * How have you used the problem solving strategies from the first project to overcome challenges so far?

Your response goes here!
 * I have learned about Basic HTML Syntax, HTML Structure, Our Coding Environment
 Browsers Compatibility, Workflow, Tree Structure, HTML Elements, HTML DOCTYPE,
 The difference between HTML 5 DOCTYPE and Other DOCTYPE, and Translating mockup
 Designs to Actual Coding.

 * All what I have learned so far as been easy except;

 * Struggling with which should precede which between tags like <strong></strong> and
 <em></em>

 * I have been able to use it very well, Since the objective of the project is 
 pretty clear.


var x = 1;

while ( x <= 20) {
    /* your stop condition goes here */
    // check divisibility
    // print Julia, James, or JuliaJames
    // increment x
    if (x % 3 === 0){
        console.log("Julia");
        x = x + 1;
        break;
    }else{
        console.log(x);
    }
}
